# Operative Systems Study Project
This project is a collaborative job made by a 3 IT students team.<br>
Our commission is to implement a **simulation** of a naval traffic, where:
- Every boat and every harbor are represented by a process, which is written in C and called by the `execve` function.
- There is a Master process that has to handle the reports of the events occurred. It also starts and close all the project in the correct way.
- We used **System-V library** to handle events with *SIGNALS* and *SEMAPHORES*.
- We also used *SHARED MEMORIES* and *MESSAGE QUEUES* to enable communication through processes.

## All the code has been generated by the team and is meant to be executed on **Linux based OS**.
--- 
The project itself has the goal to make us practice with the system calls of the **C language** in a Linux based OS.<br>
Furthermore, it has the final target to make us understand the **CPU scheduling** of the processes and the importance of **synchronization** via semaphores.<br>
<br>
We would like to specify this is our first C project. Surely, it is **not** optimized.
